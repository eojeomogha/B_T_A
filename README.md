## Unsolved Problems
Obviously the project had a lot of unfinished elements to it, but if it was all fully fleshed out, it should really be mimicking taskrabbit.com where you go in, select the type of individual you'd like to beat up, select a professional who specializes in that demographic, and then it's in your pending beatings.
(Just stating for the record that this is not a serious project) There's more to it but that's the most basic goal
